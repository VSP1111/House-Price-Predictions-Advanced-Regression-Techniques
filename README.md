House Price Prediciton is a kaggle competition where you have perform advanced regression & feature engineering techniques to predict the output . 
I have done the task by using multiple methods like ElasticNetCV ( using L1 & L2 regularisation) , RidgeCV( Only L2 regularisation ) and GradientBoostingRegressor . 
In the "otherregtechniques" file I have implemented almost all other regression models and the combination of regressors using StackingRegressor. 
    For all the various Regression models , similar technique of Feature Engineering has been used ...
